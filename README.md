# Project features:

1-the project can queue basic functions and dequeue them using python's built in queue lib.
<br/>
2-the project uses threading to run both the producer and consumer functions simultaneously.

# The next logical steps:

1-pick up one of my repos with a http server, and try to implement queueing in it.
